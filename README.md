# ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Cloud CLI Automated Installer for macOS (Bash + Homebrew)

This project provides a **Bash automation script** to install the **Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)** on macOS.  
It automatically detects the system architecture (Intel or Apple Silicon), configures permissions for Homebrew, and installs Google Cloud SDK via Homebrew Cask.

---

## üìã Features
- Detects macOS architecture (`arm64` for Apple Silicon, `x86_64` for Intel).  
- Grants proper permissions to Homebrew installation directories (`/opt/homebrew` or `/usr/local`).  
- Temporarily adds the logged-in user to the **sudoers file** for smooth installation.  
- Installs **Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)** via Homebrew.  
- Cleans up by removing the temporary sudoers entry.  
- Verifies installation after completion.
